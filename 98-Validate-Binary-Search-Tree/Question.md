# 98. Validate Binary Search Tree

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/)

Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

*   The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node's key.
*   The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node's key.
*   Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

**OJ's Binary Tree Serialization:**

The serialization of a binary tree follows a level order traversal, where '#' signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.

Here's an example:  

<pre>   1
  / \
 2   3
    /
   4
    \
     5
</pre>

The above binary tree is serialized as `"{1,2,3,#,#,4,#,#,5}"`.</div>
